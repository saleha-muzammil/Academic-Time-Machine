Courtney,"Apopka, FL","Reviewed July 16, 2023",5,"** at the Starbucks by the fire station on 436 in Altamonte Springs, FL made my day and finally helped me figure out the way to make my drink so I’d love it. She took time out to talk to me for 2 minutes to make my experience better than what I’m used to. It was much appreciated! I’ve had bad experiences one after another at the Starbucks that’s closest to me in my work building with my drinks not being great along with not great customer service from specific baristas.

I know their food comes pre packaged and only warmed at the store, so I fault the company for falsely selling food that does not meet the picture on display at the ordering kiosk.

J,"Mission, TX","Reviewed Feb. 1, 2023",2,I have had enough of this companies deceitful ways. A 16oz Grande and 24 oz Vente both have 2 shots of espresso. All you are paying for is more milk which weakens the taste. Logically if a grande has 2 shots then a vente should have 3. The shots have already been reduced in size over the years. Secondly Tips are based on performance...to ask us to tip before we can even finish cashing out is no right. You are pressuring us to leave a tip before we even get our coffee. What if the service stinks? I think you should go back to using a tip jar that way if the service is good we can tip and if not we can leave.

I received an offer to receive 50 bonus stars for six consecutive days of purchases while my daughter who rarely uses Starbucks received the same offer but for 100 bonus stars for six consecutive days of purchases. To me this says “we can take advantage of you because you are loyal and we will try to lure in the ones who aren’t loyal by giving them a better deal”.

The store manager, Lacey **, heard me asking a clerk if he knew where it was, and the next thing we knew she was looking it up on her phone and offered to write out directions on how we could get there. It was such a relief just to have the address and know that we would be able to find the object of our journey (the store was in Lacey, as it turned out)!

I love Starbucks and I'm one of the ones that would always be pissed off for tooo much ice and no foam in my drinks but I would always watch them like a hawk and tell them exactly how I like it. But I went in tonight to get a new drink. I kind of knew it was a waste of time just because how much different can it really be from what they have already. So whatever I tried it and omg never again will I try something new from them again. Very disgusting. The drink was horrible. The service was awesome. I got the youth berry and the caramel one. Horrible and $5 each - waste of money. I could have gone next door and got a frozen lemonade from Wendy's for $3 and it would have tasted better.,['No Images']

It's popular especially at the end of each year where they give a pamphlet to a consumer and fills it up with 18 stickers (and buy 18 coffees from them) to get a planner. Imagine that, 18 coffees! It's like you are giving them your salary because it's high priced. But I guess it's only practiced in the Philippines and not in other countries as here in Malaysia, it's not that appealing. Besides that it's quite expensive, locals here prefer their local coffee shops. You could only see foreigners as their customers, and what's more, they only have a few frappucinos. Well maybe they don't have sweet tooth as Filipinos. Even though its like that, I still like Starbucks especially its Vanilla Frapp. At least its selling here.

But I had saw it online and there wasn't a price on the website so when I ordered it the barista charged me $2.05 and I really enjoyed the steamer. So the next day when I went back I ordered the same thing but this time it was a different barista and I could tell by his name tag he was the manager. And before he asked for my money he hesitated a bit and talked to the other baristas and said something about my drink and then instead of charging me $2.05 he charged me $3.35 which in my opinion is a big difference in price. ,['No Images']

I ordered a venti iced caramel macchiato with cream, when my order was called it was an iced coffee with mocha something. I repeated my order and the young man who had finished making my coffee said why I don't I take it anyway? I replied ""I didn't want that, thank you"" and repeated my order. I was then made an iced coffee, plain, that had some caramel drizzled over the top of it. I asked did the caramel macchiato not have actual caramel in it? That this coffee looked like a plain iced coffee with some caramel drizzled on top? One of the girls making coffee said that's exactly how we're supposed to make them and thrust the Starbucks recipe book at me and told me to look it up if I didn't believe her. ",['No Images']

I said I was not moving my car because they pick and choose when they want to enforce this rule and when it’s convenient for them.

When the customer pays with a Starbucks Gold Card, the modifier charge is removed, reducing the price of the drink by $.50 -- one of the specific benefits of the Gold Card.

The replacement process is arduous and time consuming (8-10 weeks for a replacement to be received). In the meantime, the company expects its consumers to take their coffee to a store location for grinding when their website suggests grinding beans just before brewing: ""What is the best way to store coffee? How long will it stay fresh? Once roasted, coffee begins to lose its flavor the longer it is exposed to air and moisture. We recommend buying your coffee weekly, storing it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place and grinding it just before brewing. Coffee in an unopened flavor-lock bag will stay fresh for several months. You can learn more about how to brew great coffee in Coffee Education.""",['No Images']

I had more luck with simpler drinks, cafe Americano or just a bold coffee. My girlfriend usually orders a Grande Cafe Vanilla Light Frapuccino. She usually has to clarify or she will end up with Vanilla bean, the other blended crème based drink. A few times, they don't blend it long enough and it separates too fast. One time, they added whip cream to top, hello, it supposed to be light! Another favorite is the Vanilla latte and they sometimes forget to add enough pumps of syrup or forget to add any pumps. It's frustrating. From now on, we check our drinks carefully before we leave. If we complain, they attempt to fix on the spot.

Terri,"Indianapolis, IN","Reviewed April 10, 2009",N/A,"I have recently spoken with many Starbucks customers and have come to the same conclusion and that is that Starbucks has recently (since 4/1/09) began making their coffee weaker. I have had problems with Starbucks recently and have been in contact with their customer service group concerning consistently receiving cold coffee from their stores and the inability to receive decaf coffee at certain times of the day. To each, they reply they are trying to cut costs during tough economic times. Apparently now, a new way to cut cost is to make weaker coffee, which cost their customers more money. More money is needed because now it is necessary to pay for a shot of espresso to put in the coffee, so it tastes like it did before the decision to make weaker coffee was made. What used to be an unreasonable price for coffee is now made more unreasonable. One must ask, is Starbucks losing their customers because of the tough economic times or are they losing their customer because they keep making decisions to weaken their once impeccable brand?",['No Images']
