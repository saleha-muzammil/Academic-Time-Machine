BFS(V):
 visit V
 mark V as visited.
 push V on q (queue).
 while q not empty:
   u=pop(q)
   for each node w adjacent to u and not yet visited:
	 visit w and mark w as visited
         push w on q
 	

DFS(V):
 visit V and mark V as visited.
 push V on s (stack)

 while s not empty:
   u=stack.top()
   if u has no adjacent node that is not yet visited, then pop u and continue the next iteration
   w=any node ajacent to u and not yet visited.
   visit w and mark w as visited
   push w on stack


//recursive depth first search for graphs.
DFS(v):
 visit v and mark v as visited.
 for each w adjacent to V and not yet visited:
   DFS(w)
